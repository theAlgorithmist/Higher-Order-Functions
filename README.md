# Higher-Order Function Library

Simply stated, a higher-order function takes one or more functions as an argument and/or returns a function as a result.  Combined with predicates (functions that accept arbitrary inputs and return a boolean), we can construct a small library that replaces the functionality of literally hundreds of hand-coded functions.  When combined with Javascript's ability to create functions at runtime by specifying the function body in a string, this process becomes exceptionally powerful.

This library represents my most commonly-used set of higher-order functions.  I've used similar collections in the past across multiple environments ranging from C++ in the 1990s to ActionScript to native Javascript to Typescript.  I hope you find the library to be useful.

  - Clone the repository
  - npm install
  - get coffee (this is the most important step)


### Building and running the tests

1. npm test 

2. Standalone compilation only (npm build)

Specs (_higher-order.spec.ts) reside in the ___test___ folder and serve as usage examples for the library.
 
Enjoy!
